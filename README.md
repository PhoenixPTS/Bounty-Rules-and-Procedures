Bounty-Rules-and-Procedures
===========================

An entry for the Bounty on bitsharestalk.org for a set of rules and procedures for bounties

Bounty Rules and Procedures:

The purpose of all bounties in this community is to maximize the rate and quality of the development of DACs, their communities, and their support. Any bounty posted here should be designed to help advance one or more of these things.

Basic rules:

1) All bounties should state their purpose, goal, and maximum reward as clearly as possible.

2) Entries are not required to be the original work of the person submitting the entry, but they must detail what parts of the entry were developed by anybody besides themselves, and other members of the team submitting the entry.

3) any entry that is the work of multiple participants working together should clearly detail what percent of the bounty should go to each participant. Disputes of how the payment will be fairly distributed must be resolved before the final submission of a bounty.

4) All bounties should be submitted in an open format that is easy to use. Details for delivering various types of of deliverables (code, writing, graphics, videos, etc) should be posted along with the bounty specifications

5) Anybody submitting an entry for a given bounty will be expected to support their product for a certain number of weeks, which may vary from one bounty to another. The issuer of a particular bounty may choose to withhold the full amount of the bounty until this time has passed. The length of this time must be clearly stated in the bounty proposal, and can not be changed once an valid entry has been submitted.

6) If there is any dispute over the validity of a particular entry, this should be settled quickly. To help prevent disputes, all entries must have a brief explanation of why this particular entry is a valid entry, aka, why it satisfies the request of the bounty that was issued. However, the final decision lies with the individual that issued the bounty.

7) All bounties should have a reasonable reward for the required task. The market has the right to punish anyone who attempts to issue bounties with low rewards by simply not participating in the bounty, and/or requesting that the bounty be increased.

8) To help encourage competition, bounties will use a bidding system. This system will be detailed below in procedures.

9) Bounties might not always be managed by the person who issued them. If a separate manager is running the bounty, then they should expect to be paid a certain % of the bounty, but will only be paid once an entry has won the bounty

10) The final approval of an entry for a bounty must be given by the issuer of a bounty, not the bounty manager

Bounty Procedures:

Step 1, the bounty is created! Somebody looking to develop or improve a DAC issues a bounty with the following details:

	-Maximum bounty reward
	
	-Bounty name
	
	-Who originally issued the bounty
	
	-Who is managing the bounty, as well as what % of the bounty they are recieving
	
	-Purpose/goal of the bounty
	
	-Description of what is considered a valid entry to claim the bounty
	
	-Description of how to submit a claim for the bounty (github pull request, image submission, etc)
	
	-Any deadlines associated with the bounty, including how long people have to make a submission after the first submission is entered
	
	-How long a developer will be expected to support the bounty after submitting it, as well as what percent of the bounty will be held until this time is up
	
	-Percentage of the bounty which may be given to people who help in the evaluation phase. This is to ensure that people will try to make their code as bug free as possible.
	
	-Portion of the bounty that will be given to the first person to refer the winner
	
	-Anything else that the issuer or manager feel is necessary for a particular bounty
	

Step 2, The bounty is now in the Pending phase! During this phase the manager is responsible for answering any questions about the details of the bounty, and managing the bidding. People can also refer developers to the bounty. If they refer the winner, they will get a portion of the bounty. Bidding should work as follows:

	-The bounty has some maximum payout, defined by the issuer and/or manager of the bounty
	
	-Developers can then post lower bids to try to get the bounty. Along with their bids, they should post an expected timeline and the date he will have an entry submitted by. The manager is responsible for deciding if a bid is legitimate (for example, a bid to develop the entirety of bitshares in 3 days for only 10 PTS will probably be rejected). 
	
	-If no bids are made on a bounty, but developers show interest in completing it for a higher price, the issuer of the bounty has the right to increase the size of the bounty, as long as no developers are willing to work for the current bounty size. The issuer also has the right to cancel the bounty if there is no interest.
	
-The manager will also be responsible for balancing the 3 components of a bid: price, time to develop, and previous experience of the developers. It is up to the manager to determine which developer(s) have submitted the best bid for the bounty. He may select multiple bids from multiple developers and have them all work to develop the entry either together or separately.

-Why bother bidding lower? Because as you bid lower, fewer people will be interested in competing with you, and you’ll be considered the primary worker for the bounty

Step 3, The bounty is now in the Active phase! During this phase the developers should be working hard to try to create the ideal entry. They will want to balance speed, which will allow them to make the deadline, with accuracy, which will prevent them from losing some of the bounty to the people who will be scouring their code for bugs. Once they have what they think will win the bounty, they’ll submit their entries. Entries should follow this format:

	-Entry for the bounty in the required form
	
	-Short explanation of why the entry is should be awarded the bounty
	
	-Credit to who worked on the bounty, as well as what percent of the bounty each of them should receive

Step 4, Once an entry has been made that the the manager feels is a legitimate entry, the bounty will enter the evaluating phase. At this point in time any remaining developers have a limited amount of time to submit their entries. The manager will now be able to put up some of the funds from the bounty to form mini-bounties for things like finding bugs, security flaws, etc. Once the manager feels that there are a few entries that are ready for the issuer to go over, he will inform the bounty issuer, who will then make the final decision of which entry has won the bounty. Once this has been decided, the developers will receive their initial payment.

Step 5, The bounty is now closed. The developers will be expected to stay with their projects for a certain amount of time, defined in the bounty proposal, and will receive the rest of their bounty once this time is over. The developers are encouraged to invest their bounty into Angel Shares, which will allow them to increase their holdings in future DACs. This also allows Invictus Innovations to sponsor more bounties.

Tips for Teams:

-Teams of developers should start by deciding on a ‘project manager’ to organize the team and to be the voice of the team on the bounty thread

-The project manager is responsible for managing the team’s bids on the bounty thread

-The project manager is also responsible for organizing the team’s development efforts and their communications

-Teams should not use the bounty thread as their primary form of communication, but may use private messaging, email, video chat, etc.

-Teams should quickly determine who will do what tasks, as well as how they will all work together

-By the time a team is ready to make an entry for the bounty, they should have reached an agreement as to what percent of the bounty each individual on the team will receive. Failure to do so will result in delays and confusion for everyone, and the bounty manager may deny them some or all of the bounty if the team members continue to argue about it.

-Payment will be handled by the issuer of a bounty, and should be sent to each member individually. Each member of the team will be expected to provide their own payment address.
